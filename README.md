# Analysing YouTube Channel's data 

# Aim: 
The main objective of the project was to preprocess a dataset by handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns. The cleaned data was then analyzed to answer the following questions:
 - Which countries have the most YouTube channels?
 - What are the trends in YouTube channel creation over time?
 - Is there any correlation between subscriber count and view count?

Data Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/2024-youtube-channels-1-million)

# Conclusion: 
The analysis revealed that the USA has the highest number of YouTube channels compared to other countries. The year 2020 saw a significant spike in the creation of YouTube channels. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between subscriber count and views. However, an outlier was identifiedâ€”this channel, which holds the highest number of subscribers globally, surprisingly had fewer views than other channels with smaller subscriber bases.
